"""
This is the first iteration of a game server
that should, at least for now, serve only as
a game API. It should create and store game
and player data. It should NOT serve up a
webpage or something similar, although I
may expand it to fulfill that purpose at a
later date.

Please NOTE: credentials are NOT meant to be
legitimate credentials, and cheating/impersonating
is NOT REGULATED. It's literally just so you can
see your hand and stats on multiple devices. Thus,
I'm not going to make this very secure as far as the
database itself, at least. Its contents will be secured
to the best of my ability, but that's about the best
I can offer.

I'll ask everyone to make sure their passwords are
NOT ones they've used ANYWHERE else, because although
these will be hashed etc to the best of ability,
I have no real idea of industry standards and the like,
and there is basically nothing worth defending with a
crazy password (your stats..?), so that'll be my advice.
