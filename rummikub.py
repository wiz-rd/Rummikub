Some notes:

Store the game state in files!!! Or something similar. If I store it in RAM,
it would be really easy to take down the server. It can still be taken down by DoS attacks
even if I save it into files, but they would have to be more coordinated and it's less likely to happen
simply due to traffic. Not that I expect any more traffic than literally just us, but I digress.
This means that the only part of the game stored in RAM is on the client's side, presumably in their
browser.

When a game ends, players with tiles in their hand LOSE points relative to that score.
But, in a needlessly convuluted manner, the winner GAINS the TOTAL points everyone else loses
by having tiles in their hand. Sick.

I need to store the state of the table BEFORE a turn begins, because if a player reaches the time
limit, then everything needs to be returned to how it was before (and a tile needs to be given to them
as their turn ends).
