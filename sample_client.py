This is just a simple script meant to emulate a client.
The client will almost definitely be written in JS
and deployed as a website, so this is meant to help
with testing my API. I'm aware of the existence of
services such as Postman and the like, but I'm
unfamiliar with them. I may implement them shortly
if I get the opportunity, but for now, this will
suffice.
